Airman:
	- create new nodes from loaded node at correct position
	- connect them with a bezier curve
	- the ability to edit nodes
	- draw text
	- ability to move viewport
	- user variable nodes
	- conditionals
	- user can move boxes

Yok:
	- come up with structure of editing window perhaps?
	- wait till airman is done, then figure out how to make previews of the story
	- do image uploading, then the markup for images

Shawb:
	- create style for buttons, text areas
	- Figure out how to make user variable appear when you click the user variable button (it should appear in the section yok makes)
	- make something which parses the current state of for example the user variables and creates html lines for the user to edit and click and whatnot.
	- try and give this behavior.
