todo:
Airman:
	- delete button for choices on node
	- user variable nodes
	- conditionals  (once previews are done)
	- advanced box spawn mechanics (make them spawn in the right spot)

Yok:
	- come up with structure of editing window perhaps?
	- wait till airman is done, then figure out how to make previews of the story
	- do image uploading, then the markup for images

Shawb:
	- Figure out how to make user variable appear when you click the user variable button (it should appear in the section yok makes)
	- make something which parses the current state of for example the user variables and creates html lines for the user to edit and click and whatnot.
	- try and give this behavior.
